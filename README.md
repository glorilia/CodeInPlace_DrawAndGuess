# CodeInPlace_DrawAndGuess

To play, run GAproject.py
It will use the text file Drawing_Coordinates and the illustrations
in the images directory to randomly choose an illustration.
The player scrolls over the dots as they appear, creating an outline.
Once 30 seconds are up, or all the dots have been connected, the 
player is then asked to guess what they've just drawn.
They are told whether they are correct, and shown the true illustration,
which appears behind their drawing.
The player is then free to go another round or quit.
