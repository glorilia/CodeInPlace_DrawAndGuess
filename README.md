# CodeInPlace_DrawAndGuess

To play, run GAproject.py on Python 3 or higher.


It will use the text file `Drawing_Coordinates` and the illustrations
in the `images` directory to randomly choose an illustration.


To play, scroll over the dots as they appear, creating a simple outline drawing.
Once 30 seconds are up, or all the dots have been connected, the 
player is then asked to guess what they've just drawn.


They are told whether they are correct, and shown the true illustration,
which appears behind their drawing.
The player is then free to go another round or quit.
